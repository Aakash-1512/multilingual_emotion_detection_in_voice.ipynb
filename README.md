# Multilingual Emotion Detection in Voice

This project focuses on detecting emotions from speech audio across multiple languages using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It utilizes audio processing, feature extraction, and classification models to analyze and predict emotional states such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more.

## 🚀 Features

* Detects emotions in voice recordings
* Supports multiple languages
* Uses audio preprocessing techniques (e.g., MFCCs)
* Applies deep learning models (e.g., CNN, LSTM)
* Visualization of data and results

## 📊 Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Librosa (for audio processing)
* NumPy, Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch
* Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📦 Dataset

The notebook supports multilingual emotional speech datasets such as:

* [RAVDESS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio)
* [CREMA-D](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ejlok1/cremad)
* [TESS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chekag/tess-speech-emotion-recognition)

Ensure the datasets are downloaded and structured appropriately in your working directory.

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook multilingual_emotion_detection_in_voice.ipynb
```

## 📈 Usage

1. Preprocess the audio data using MFCC or spectrograms.
2. Train a classification model on labeled emotional speech data.
3. Evaluate the model on test data.
4. Analyze predictions and visualizations to assess performance.

## 🎯 Emotion Categories

Typical emotion labels used in this project include:

* Happy
* Sad
* Angry
* Fearful
* Neutral
* Disgust
* Surprise

## 📝 Results
